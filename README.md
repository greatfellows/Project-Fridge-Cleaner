All team members are responsible for their work, but this is a collaborative project. Everyone had a hand in helping everyone else. 
We resolve our conflicts through setting a timer, where both sides get 5 minutes to prove themselves, and then we vote. In the event of a tie, we will look for unbiased outside input, or flip a coin.
